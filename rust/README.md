# ICP Rust Recipe Example

This example demonstrates how to use the built-in `rust` recipe type to build Rust canisters.

## Overview

The `rust` recipe type provides a streamlined way to build Rust canisters using Cargo with the WASM target. This is one of the built-in recipe types provided by ICP-CLI for common canister development workflows.

## Configuration

The [`icp.yaml`](./icp.yaml) file configures a canister using the built-in `rust` recipe:

```yaml
canisters:
  - name: {{ project-name }}
    recipe:
      type: "@dfinity/rust"
      configuration:
        # cargo package for canister (required field)
        package: {{ project-name }} 
        shrink: true
        # optional
        candid: {{ project-name }}.did
        metadata:
          - name: "crate:version"
            value: 1.0.0
```

### Key Components

- **`type: rust`**: Uses the built-in Rust recipe type
- **`package`**: Specifies the Cargo package name to build (required)

## Project Structure

- [`Cargo.toml`](./Cargo.toml): Cargo project configuration with WASM target setup
- [`src/lib.rs`](./src/lib.rs): Rust canister implementation using ic-cdk
- [`.gitignore`](./gitignore): Git ignore rules for Rust projects

## How It Works

1. ICP-CLI uses the built-in `rust` recipe resolver
2. The resolver generates build steps that:
   - Build the specified Cargo package with `--target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release`
   - Move the resulting WASM file to the output path
   - Inject metadata about the Cargo version used
3. The canister is built and ready for deployment

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain with WASM target support
- Install via: <https://rustup.rs/>
- Add WASM target: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`

## Build Process

The recipe automatically:

1. Compiles the Rust code to WASM using Cargo
2. Extracts the WASM binary from the target directory
3. Renames it to match ICP-CLI's expected output format
4. Injects build metadata using ic-wasm

## Use Cases

- Standard Rust canister development
- Projects using ic-cdk for Internet Computer development
- Canisters that don't require custom build logic
- Multi-package Rust workspaces

## Run it

```
# Start a local network
icp network start --background

# Build and deploy the canister
icp deploy

# make a call the canister
icp canister call {{project-name}} greet '("Internet Computer")'

# Stop the network
icp network stop
```
